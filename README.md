# Hagiwo-Mozzi-FM-Arduino-VCO

This is a simple 1 pcb+panel design using Hagiwo's Mozzi library based Arduino FM VCO .
t's a straight drop in eurorack size panel with smd components and no cover plate.
This project is not my design nor software. It is just a basic,cheap pcb, using Hagiwo's original work. 
Cost for a 5 batch (5 is a minimum order) from jlcpcb or pcbway should be in the $20/$25 range.

You can find all info on this project, schematics, code and info here (please support Hagiwo's work if you can) : https://note.com/solder_state/n/n88317851a4c7

All you need for this project is the code (see Hagiwo's page above) to program the arduino.
You then can use the gerber and BOM to order the parts for your project, idealy pre-soldered SMD components.

You will then need to source and manually solder a 16 pin IDE connector, 3 100k pots and 5 audio connector to complete the project...
and enjoy
