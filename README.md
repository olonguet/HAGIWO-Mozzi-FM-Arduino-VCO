# Hawigo-Mozzi-FM-Arduino-VCO

This is a simple 1 pcb+panel design using Hawigo's Mozzi library based Arduino FM VCO .
t's a straight drop in eurorack size panel with smd components and no cover plate.
This project is not my design nor software. It is just a basic,cheap pcb, using HAWIGO's original work.

You can find all info on this project, schematics, code and info here : https://note.com/solder_state/n/n88317851a4c7

All you need for this project is the code (see HAWIGO's page above) to program the arduino.
You then can use the gerber and BOM to order the parts for your project, idealy pre-soldered SMD components.

You will then need to source and manually solder a 16 pin IDE connector, 3 100k pots and 5 audio connector to complete the project...
and enjoy
