You can find all info on this project, schematics, code and info here : https://note.com/solder_state/n/n88317851a4c7

All you need for this project is the code to program the arduino
You then can use the gerber and BOM to order the parts for your project, ideally pre soldered.
You will then need to source a 16 pin IDE connector, 3 100k pots and 5 audio connector to complete the project
